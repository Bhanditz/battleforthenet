title: California can still save net neutrality
intro_html: |
  Telecom giants like AT&T and Comcast tried everything to kill the best state level net neutrality bill in the country, California’s SB 822, but they failed. The bill just passed the Assembly. But now the Senate must approve it, and ISPs are still lobbying fiercely to defeat it. **Call the California Senate right now and tell them to pass SB 822 and restore net neutrality!**
