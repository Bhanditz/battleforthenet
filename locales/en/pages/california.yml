title: California can still save net neutrality
intro_html: |
  Telecom giants like AT&T and Comcast tried everything to water down the best state level net neutrality bill in the country, California’s SB 822, but they failed. The bill has been restored and is now headed for a vote on the Assembly floor. But the ISPs are still lobbying fiercely to defeat it. **Call the California Assembly right now and tell them to pass SB 822 and restore net neutrality!**
