title: Breaking: AT&T-funded state lawmakers just gutted the California net neutrality bill
body_html: |
  California had proposed the strongest and most comprehensive state level net neutrality legislation in the country: SB 822. 
  **But the bill was just eviscerated by a corrupt committee led by a chairman who counts AT&T as a top donor.** He forced 
  hostile amendments that add gaping loopholes for ISPs to abuse their power, charge us more, and discriminate.</br>
  </br>
  Call your California Assembly members and tell them to take action to stop the gutting of SB-822 and pass the bill in its 
  original form to protect net neutrality for all Californians.
