title: California can still save net neutrality
body_html: |
  Telecom giants like AT&T and Comcast tried everything to water down the best state level net neutrality bill in the 
  country, Californiaâ€™s SB 822, but they failed. The bill has been restored and is now headed for a vote on the Assembly 
  floor. But the ISPs are still lobbying fiercely to defeat it. **Call the California Assembly right now and tell them to 
  pass SB 822 and restore net neutrality!**
