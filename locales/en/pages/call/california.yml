title: AT&T-funded state lawmakers just gutted the California net neutrality bill
body_html: |
  California had proposed the strongest and most comprehensive state level net neutrality legislation in the country: SB 822. 
  **But a corrupt committee &mdash; led by a chairman who counts AT&T as a top donor &mdash; added gaping loopholes to
  allow ISP abuses.** </br>
  </br>
  Call the California Assembly. Tell them you want REAL net neutrality. Stop gutting SB 822 and pass the bill in its 
  original form.
