        Members of Congress have packed up and left Washington, returning to
        their home districts for August recess. Thereâ€™s one big problem, though:
        Lawmakers have left their constituents out to dry by failing to restore
        crucial net neutrality protections gutted by the Federal Communications
        Commission (FCC). After a groundswell of activism, the Senate passed a
        Congressional Review Act resolution this spring to reverse the FCC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the resolution has moved to the House, where it needs just 40 more
        votes to passâ€”so weâ€™re organizing meetings between key representatives
        and their constituents to demand they publicly support the CRA. But the
        clock is tickingâ€Šâ€” if the CRA resolution doesnâ€™t get a vote this year,
        it dies when the new Congress comes into session in January 2019.
      </p>

      <p>
        If lawmakers hear directly from enough passionate constituents, we can
        get the 40 remaining votes we need to overturn the FCCâ€™s net neutrality
        repeal. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re organizing and training people passionate about
        net neutrality to meet with their representative or staff in district
        during August recess.
