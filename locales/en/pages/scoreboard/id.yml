      Asm. {name} hasn’t come out in support of SB 822’s strong net neutrality protections. Companies like Comcast and AT&T are spending and donating millions of dollars to convince legislators to vote against or not vote for SB 822. Let Asm. {name} know that you are watching and that siding with Team Cable is a betrayal of Californians.

   {name} supports net neutrality by signing the petition to discharge the FCC’s decision to destroy net neutrality regulations.  This prevents cable companies throttling traffic, blocking access to websites and apps, and imposing unfair fees on everyday Americans like me.

    {name} took {amount} in “campaign donations” from big ISPs.  No wonder this representative opposes net neutrality protections that would prevent companies like Comcast, Charter and AT&T from throttling traffic, blocking access to websites and apps, and imposing unfair fees.
