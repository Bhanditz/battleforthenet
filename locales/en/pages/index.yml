  The FCC repealed net neutrality, but Congress can bring it back. We need our lawmakers 
  to reject fake legislation pushed by telecom lobbyists and fight for real net neutrality 
  that protects the public against throttling, censorship, and unfair fees.  **Fill out the 
  form below to contact Congress and demand they support net neutrality now.**

    The December 2017 FCC vote to destroy the net neutrality protections cannot stand. 

    With just one willfully careless action, the FCC ignored the outcry of tens of millions of people, injuring our economy and free speech without so much as a single public hearing.

    We need members of Congress to stand up for the open Internet and for the digital rights of their constituents. So I’m calling on you to work with your colleagues to restore net neutrality through legislation that will will protect the American public from throttling, censorship and unfair fees.

    Thank you.

    title: Net neutrality was repealed, but the fight has just begun

        The FCC’s repeal of net neutrality officially kicked in on

        target="_blank">June 11th, 2018</a>. The Internet as we know it didn’t end overnight. Internet providers 
        like AT&T, Verizon and Comcast have already begun

        People are angry. And rightly so. We need to channel that anger productively and flood House lawmakers
        with calls and emails demanding that they use their legislative powers to create 
        protections against throttling, censorship and unfair fees.

        So take whatever corner of the Internet that you control — whether it’s a major platform or a personal
        Instagram account — and harness its reach to pressure Congress. Here’s how:

          artwork in our gallery <a href="/media/#social">here.</a></li>

          <li>If you run a website or blog, post our banner ads to let your visitors know you support net neutrality.
          We’ve provided examples in our gallery <a href="/media/#banners">here</a>.

    title: Here’s how we get Congress to save net neutrality
    body_html: |
      Our elected officials in Congress can overrule the FCC and save net neutrality by passing 
      legislation that prevents Internet providers from throttling traffic, censoring online 
      content, and imposing unfair fees on businesses and users alike.  

      This will require a bipartisan effort from lawmakers, which may seem like science fiction in 
      these deeply divided political times.  But net neutrality is not a partisan issue.  In fact, 
      an overwhelming majority of Americans 
      <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/overwhelming-bipartisan-majority-opposes-repealing-net-neutrality-survey-finds-300569665.html"
      target="_blank">support net neutrality</a>,
      including Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike.  And we’ve successfully pushed 
      lawmakers to 
      <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/16/net-neutrality-is-getting-a-big-vote-in-the-senate-today-heres-what-to-expect/"
      target="_blank">cross the aisle</a> in support of net neutrality efforts before.

      <h3>
        <br>
        Here’s how we’ll do it this time:
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li class="calls">
          <h4>
            <img src="/images/gradient-calls.png" alt="">
            <span>Flood them with calls and emails</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            When millions of people call and email their representatives, Congress listens.
            That’s why we developed a widget that website owners can place on their site,
            giving their site’s users the opportunity to contact Congress. And we’ve created
            art assets that will allow individuals to spread the word on powerful
            social media platforms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="constituents">
          <h4>
            <img src="/images/gradient-constituents.png" alt="">
            <span>In-district constituent pressure</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            It’s important for lawmakers to see the people who support net neutrality.  We’ll
            help schedule in-person events, protests, meetings, and canvassing to mobilize
            constituencies (
            <a href="https://www.vetsforthe.net/"target="_blank">like veterans</a>
            ) that lawmakers listen to.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="business">
          <h4>
            <img src="/images/gradient-business.png" alt="">
            <span>Mobilizing small businesses</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            In Washington, money talks. So lawmakers
            listen to the small business owners in their districts because those
            business owners are vital to the local economy. We need to reach out to
            small business owners to ask them to sign our
            <a href="https://www.businessesfornetneutrality.com/">petition</a> in
            support of net neutrality, then we hand-deliver this petition to our
            politicians.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      We're making Congress listen
    body_html: |
      Voters from across the political spectrum agree: they don't want their
      cable company to control what they see and do online. The FCC's reckless
      repeal of net neutrality has sparked an unprecedented backlash, as
      millions of Americans have contacted their lawmakers in protest.  The
      numbers below represent actions taken through BattleForTheNet.com and its
      partners. Many more have taken action on other sites or contacted their
      lawmakers directly.

      To help convince the House, <a href="#bftn-action-form">contact congress

      It can be hard to keep track of who supports net neutrality and who doesn’t … 
      especially with cable companies and their lobbyists pushing for fake net 
      neutrality legislation. So we’re here to help.

      Below you'll find a link to a list of your state's senators and representatives. 
      The lawmakers in green signed a discharge petition to overturn the FCC’s net 
      neutrality repeal, so tell them how much you appreciate their support on this 
      important issue. The lawmakers in red failed to support the discharge petition, 
      so contact their office to let them know that actions speak louder than words.

    title: What is net neutrality? Why does it matter?
    body_html: |
      Net neutrality is the principle that everyone should have access to
      websites and apps, preventing Internet providers like Comcast & Verizon
      from creating “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/verizons-mobile-video-wont-count-against-data-caps-but-netflix-will/"

      target="_blank">blocking access</a> to their competitor's products. This
      principle has guided the world wide web from the beginning, and has been
      protected by federal policy under Republican AND Democrat leadership since
      the <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf"
      target="_blank">early 2000s</a>.

      Unfortunately, Internet providers ignored this policy and even actively
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014)"
      target="_blank">sued the federal government</a> to destroy net neutrality
      protections … and they won. Their anti-consumer practices finally convinced
      the FCC to issue the Open Internet Order as a last resort in 2015. But
      under new leadership, the FCC has removed these regulations, threatening
      to end the web as we know it.
