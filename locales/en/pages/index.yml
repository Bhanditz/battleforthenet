title: Net neutrality is freedom on the Internet
intro_html: |
  The FCC voted to repeal net neutrality and let big cable companies control the
  Internet.  But after millions of us flooded Congress with emails and calls,
  the Senate overturned the FCC’s disastrous decision. Now we need the House of
  Representatives to do the same. **Tell your lawmakers you want freedom on the
  Internet now!**

    Last December's FCC vote to destroy the net neutrality protections cannot stand.

    I’m calling on you to work with your colleagues to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a "resolution of disapproval" reversing the FCC's vote.

    The FCC's December decision willfully ignored the outcry of tens of millions of people, and it abdicated the FCC's responsibility to protect the internet from ISP blocking and discrimination. The FCC has injured our economy and free speech in just one action, all without so much as a single public hearing.

    We need members of Congress to stand up for the open internet and for the digital rights of their constituents now. Please co-sponsor, sign the discharge petition for, and vote for the CRA Resolution of Disapproval that would overturn the FCC's December "Restoring Internet Freedom" vote.

    Thank you.

    title: Net neutrality ends June 11th, but the fight has just begun
    body_html: |
      The FCC’s repeal of net neutrality will officially take place on
      <a href="https://medium.com/@fightfortheftr/the-senate-just-voted-to-save-net-neutrality-e2fa2fa67b79"
        target="_blank">June 11th</a>.  Starting that day, Internet providers like Comcast will legally be
        allowed to censor websites, block apps and services, and charge us extra fees to access online content.
        The Internet as we know it won’t suddenly end. But with each second that passes until net neutrality is
        restored, it will be slowly dying.

        People will be angry. And rightly so. We need to channel that anger productively and flood House
        lawmakers with calls and emails demanding that they use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to overrule
        the FCC.

        So on June 11th, take whatever corner of the Internet that you control, whether it’s a major platform or
        a personal instagram account, and harness its reach to pressure Congress. Here’s how:

        <ul class="basic-list">

    title: Here’s how we get Congress save net neutrality
    body_html: |
      Our elected officials in Congress can overrule the FCC and save net
      neutrality using the Congressional Review Act (CRA). But they’ll only do
      it if we make them. The CRA resolution <a
      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/16/net-neutrality-is-getting-a-big-vote-in-the-senate-today-heres-what-to-expect/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b708d06a9545"
      target="_blank">passed the Senate 52-47</a> in a historic upset. But now
      we’re fighting an uphill battle to get the House of Representatives to do
      the same. It’s not going to be easy, but if the whole Internet comes
      together to fight, we can win. Here’s how:

      In the House, we’ll need 218 lawmakers to sign on to a “<a
      href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/path-victory-net-neutrality-house-representatives-and-how-you-can-help"
      target="_blank">discharge petition</a>” in order to force a vote past leadership
      to the floor. That means we’ll need to convince all the Democrats and about 25
      Republicans to support the CRA. The clock is ticking — if the CRA resolution
      doesn’t get a vote this year, it dies when the new Congress comes into session.
      <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/how-we-won/">We've done it before.</a>

          </h4>
          <p>
            When millions of people call and
            email their representatives, Congress listens. That’s why we developed
            a widget that website owners can place on their site, giving their
            site’s users the opportunity to contact Congress. And we’ve created
            art assets that will allow individuals to spread the word on powerful
            social media platforms.

      Voters from across the political spectrum agree: they don't want their
      cable company to control what they see and do online. The FCC's reckless
      repeal of net neutrality has sparked an unprecedented backlash, as
      millions of Americans have contacted their lawmakers in protest.  The
      numbers below represent actions taken through BattleForTheNet.com and its
      partners. Many more have taken action on other sites or contacted their
      lawmakers directly.

  net-neutrality:
    title: What is net neutrality? Why does it matter?
    body_html: |
      Net neutrality is the principle that everyone should have access to
      websites and apps, preventing Internet providers like Comcast & Verizon
      from creating “<a

      the FCC to issue the Open Internet Order as a last resort in 2015. But
      under new leadership, the FCC has removed these regulations, threatening
      to end the web as we know it.
