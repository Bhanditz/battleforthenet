<h2>
We are Team Internet, and we support net neutrality.
</h2>
<p>
We believe in the free and open Internet, with no arbitrary fees or slow lanes for sites that can't pay. All of the people, companies, and organizations below have taken a stand for "Title II reclassification," the only option that let the FCC stop Team Cable from breaking the key principles of the Internet we love. And that's what the FCC just voted for.
