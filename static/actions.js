No single firm — and especially one that ranks as the most-hated company in America — should be handed this much power over the future of media and the Internet.\n\nThe combined company would be an Internet and cable TV juggernaut with unmatched power to crush competition and hike prices for consumers. In fact, Comcast has admitted that prices will only go up.\n\nComcast is already the nation's largest Internet provider. With this takeover, Comcast would control the wires reaching into nearly 6 out of every 10 American homes. Comcast has been caught before abusing its gatekeeper power and violating Net Neutrality. Such problems will only worsen if this once-unthinkable deal moves forward.\n\nThere’s no question this takeover would harm the public interest the FCC is supposed to protect. You have said yourself that America has too little broadband competition. I urge you to block the proposed merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable.",
