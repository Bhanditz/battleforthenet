Don't let the FCC kill net neutrality! The Battle for the Net is a
collaboration between [Fight for the Future][2], [Demand Progress][3], [Free Press Action Fund][4]  and a
coalition of people and companies who care about keeping the Internet free.
If you have a web site, you can get involved by embedding our FCC Contact
Form. Or, if you have technical skills and time to volunteer, you can help us
win one of the biggest fights for Internet freedom EVER!


### Use our Day of Action widget

We've created a tool that lets people directly contact the FCC and Congress to stop net neutrality rules from being rolled back.

Follow these instructions to install it on your site: http://widget.battleforthenet.com/

### Contributing to our code

We are looking for skilled web developers to help us build the front page on
our [battleforthenet.com][1] site. If you're interested in volunteering, contact <sarah@fightforthefuture.org>
